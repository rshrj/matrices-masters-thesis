\noindent Below is an example of how subsectioning works. The sections and subsections will be included in the table of contents, while subsubsections will not be in the table of contents but still have their own title in the text.

\section{Bosonic theory at $(N, K)$}

\subsection{Gauge fixing}

\subsection{Symmetries and Noether charges}

\section{Gauge invariant observables}

\section{Visualizing Matrix configurations}

\subsection{Matrix spherical harmonics}

\subsection{Emergent geometry using effective Hamiltonians}

\section{Scaling arguments}
