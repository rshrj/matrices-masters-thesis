We present an exposition of Matrix theory as developed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen 
Shenker and Leonard Susskind. The bosonic sector of Matrix theory is lifted from the usual 
9-dimensional setting to arbitrary dimensions ($K$) and studied in the abstract. Numerical 
simulations of this theory for a range of values of $N$ (the size of matrices) and $K$ show
exceedingly positive results, starting with sub-exponential chaos in phase space and definite 
scaling behavior. The sub-exponential growth of a patch of initial conditions is analyzed as a function of $(N, K)$ and results presented. Higher-order gauge invariant operators are then studied.

Using a novel method of semi-classical analysis via coherent states and the $2$-PI quantum effective action, quantum corrections to classical Matrix theory are considered. At one-loop, the classic result of $\mathcal{O}(v^4/r^7)$ supergravity interactions between D0-brane clusters is recovered. Flat directions in the quantum effective potential are then analyzed and implications for black hole microstates in Matrix theory are discussed.
